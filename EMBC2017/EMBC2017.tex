\begin{abstract}

The sit-to-stand (STS) motion is an essential activity of daily living and commonly used clinical assessment. In this paper, we introduce a method for the quantitative analysis of STS capability using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability. This approach computes the backwards reachable set, defined as the set of states from which standing is achievable. We model STS as a hybrid system with two modes representing the seated and rising phases of the action. The framework considers the dynamics and constraints of each mode and accounts for the seat-off transition. We present preliminary results for typical and limited joint torque capabilities...results?... This serves as a proof of concept for applying reachable set tools to the analysis of STS dynamics.
