\subsection{Experimental Validation}
An initial validation of this analysis method was performed on a single subject under informed consent (UC Berkeley IRB:2015-07-7767). The subject performed the sit-to-stand action with their arms crossed in front of them. Five STS motions were performed for three methods: 1) No guidance, 2) fast dynamic-standing, and 3) stabilization standing. The PhaseSpace Impulse X2  active motion capture system was used to collect kinematic data at 480 Hz. 

The method described in \cite{matthew2016} was used to extract joint angles and angular velocities for each STS motion. Due to the absence of force-data, seat-off was determined from the angular velocity of the knee joint.
